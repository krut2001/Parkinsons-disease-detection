Detection of Parkinson's Disease with Machine Learning


### What is Parkinson’s Disease?
Parkinson’s disease is a central nervous system disorder. Its symptoms occur because of low dopamine levels in the brain. Four Primary symptoms are tremor, rigidity, slow movement and balance problems. Till now no cure for Parkinson’s Disease is known, treatment aims to reduce the effects of the symptoms.
